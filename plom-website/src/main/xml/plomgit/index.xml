		<h1>PlomGit</h1>
		
		<p>PlomGit is a basic, open source git client. Although it only supports a limited number of features, it should be sufficient for version controlling personal files.</p>
		
		<p>It is programmed using Flutter and uses the <a href="https://libgit2.org/">libgit2 library</a>.</p>
		
		<p>The source code for PlomGit is available on <a href="https://github.com/my2iu/PlomGit">GitHub</a>.</p>

		<p>Storing user data properly and securely is a heavy responsibility, and I do not want to take on that burden. As such, the app does not intentionally gather information about users.</p>
